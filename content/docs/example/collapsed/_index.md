This section describes the type classes, data types, interfaces and functions provided by the Prelude package. The standard Prelude package is automatically included in all BSV packages. You do not need to take any special action to use any of the features defined in the Prelude package.
Section 3 describes BSCâ€™s collection of standard libraries. To use any of these libraries in a design you must explicitly import the library package.
